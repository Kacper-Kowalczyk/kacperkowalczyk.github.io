The central theme of this thesis is the unimportance of personal identity. I begin in Chapter 1 by developing new Parfitian arguments for the unimportance of personal identity in morality, paying special attention to their implications in population ethics. In Chapter 2 I analyse Mark Johnston’s similar metaphysics driven challenge to person based morality, but argue that it is less successful than my own. In Chapter 3 I lay out choices facing egalitarians in population ethics, arguing against some recently prominent forms of egalitarianism. In Chapter 4 I provide new decision theoretic arguments against deontic constraints on harming, suggesting that it is consequentialism rather than deontology that can better respect persons. In Chapter 5 I introduce transfinite extensions of the familiar value theoretic principles of transitivity and acyclicity. I use them to try to resolve some key issues in population ethics, concerning the value of creating new people and the procreative asymmetry. In Chapter 6 I aim to support these transfinite principles by analysing their role in the theory of rational choice.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract1' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'><i>Abstract</i>: This paper develops transfinite extensions of transitivity and acyclicity in the context of population ethics. They are used to argue that it is better to add good lives, worse to add bad lives, and equally good to add neutral lives, where a life’s value is understood as personal value. These conclusions rule out a number of theories of population ethics, feed into an argument for the repugnant conclusion, and allow us to reduce different number comparisons to same number ones. Challenges to these arguments are addressed, including the issue of comparing existence and nonexistence in terms of personal value, the possibility of minimal quanta of time and life, and the meaningfulness of measuring closeness between outcomes with different population sizes. An asymmetry is uncovered between transfinite cycles of worseness and betterness, supporting a version of the weak procreative asymmetry. Transfinite transitivity principles are also favourably compared to the better known principles of continuity.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract11' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'><i>Abstract</i>: Personites are like continuant people but shorter lived. Johnston has recently argued that their existence is incompatible with any plausible form of ethics and, so, they cannot exist. He suggests that broadly naturalistic accounts of our place in the world must also, therefore, be wrong. I will argue that Johnston’s arguments fail. To do that I propose an alternative account of intrinsicness, defend arguments from above against arguments from below, and clarify the meaning of reductionism about persons. I also show that commonsense ethics is far from unworkable even if persons and personites can’t differ in moral status. My arguments draw on Johnston’s earlier debate with Parfit about personal identity and the place of ordinary concerns in a naturalistic world. I conclude by identifying general lessons about the ethics metaphysics relationship and by sketching a more pressing but metaphysics free problem that naturally arises from Johnston’s recent discussion.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract4' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'><i>Abstract</i>: According to communal egalitarianism, the value of an outcome is the result of balancing total wellbeing and the badness of inequality. According to weighted egalitarianism, it is the result of aggregating people’s wellbeing while giving priority to the relatively worse off. Unlike communal egalitarianism, weighted egalitarianism escapes the levelling down objection and can be supported by a veil of ignorance argument. The two kinds of egalitarianism can agree in same number cases but disagree in different number cases. This poses a dilemma for weighted egalitarians. On the one hand, they have good reasons to accept limited principles of existence independence and hence a specific formula called “the geometric Gini”. On the other hand, the most straightforward application of the geometric Gini in different number cases yields counterintuitive verdicts which are at odds with egalitarian thinking. This suggests egalitarians should be communal rather than weighted egalitarians, meaning they have to give up on many promised benefits of the latter. We also see more clearly the choices we need to make if we want our value theory to reflect aversion to inequality in welfare.</blockquote>

It shows that if Allais preferences track individual betterness, then we cannot hold on to independently plausible ethical principles: ex ante Pareto, statewise dominance, and anonymity. The paper shows that proponents of Allais preferences will find it difficult to reject these three principles. This suggests that Allais preferences cannot track individual betterness after all.

It shows that the principles of weak ex-ante Pareto and statewise dominance are incompatible with a nearly uncontroversial utilitarian claim about outcomes where infinitely many people exist. The principles at issue are then clarified and defended. The incompatibility means that utilitarianism is ex-ante/ex-post inconsistent in infinite worlds. It is well known that ex-ante/ex-post inconsistency is a source of problems for egalitarians and prioritarians in finite worlds.  It turns out that utilitarians share these problems. The paper then explains how the problem is an example of an “infinite free lunch” and how it is related to other problem cases for utilitarianism in infinite worlds.</blockquote>

In particular, it shows that controversial principles of continuity in some well-known impossibility theorems can be replaced by related but significantly more compelling principles of transfinite transitivity and transfinite acyclicity. These are natural infinite generalizations of transitivity and acyclicity, which are two well-established principles of value theory. Like continuity, transfinite transitivity and acyclicity are sensitive to the choice of a topology, here understood in terms of convergence and closeness. Two notions of convergence are discussed. The first main result is that, given transfinite transitivity and the first notion of convergence, it is impossible to combine a weak Pareto principle and finite anonymity. The second main result is that, given transfinite acyclicity and the second notion of convergence, it is impossible to combine strong Pareto and finite anonymity, impossible to combine transitivity and the Pigou Dalton principle, and impossible to accept an uncontroversial extension of utilitarianism to infinite worlds.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract7' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'><i>Abstract</i>: This paper explores the relationship between rational choice theory and the principle of transfinite transitivity, a generalization of transitivity in contexts where our domain of evaluation is equipped with a notion of convergence. The interest of transfinite transitivity comes from its applications: in variable population ethics it can be used to argue that it is always worse to create a miserable life and that it is always better to create a happy life, and in infinite population ethics it can be used to establish the impossibility of combining a Pareto principle and a weak anonymity principle. This paper will argue that if transitivity can be supported by the role it plays in the theory of rational choice, then so can transfinite transitivity. In finite option sets, transitivity helps secure the existence of choiceworthy options, is implied by consistency conditions on permissible choice, and can be supported by money pump arguments. This paper shows that transfinite transitivity plays the same role in infinite compact sets, and that nothing else can plausibly play the same role in infinite noncompact sets. The role of compactness is clarified and defended. The distinctions developed in the paper are then applied to a classic infinite-decision puzzle, Satan’s Apple.</blockquote>
