The central theme of this thesis is the unimportance of personal identity. I begin in Chapter 1 by developing new Parfitian arguments for the unimportance of personal identity in morality, paying special attention to their implications in population ethics. In Chapter 2 I analyse Mark Johnston’s similar metaphysics driven challenge to person based morality, but argue that it is less successful than my own. In Chapter 3 I lay out choices facing egalitarians in population ethics, arguing against some recently prominent forms of egalitarianism. In Chapter 4 I provide new decision theoretic arguments against deontic constraints on harming, suggesting that it is consequentialism rather than deontology that can better respect persons. In Chapter 5 I introduce transfinite extensions of the familiar value theoretic principles of transitivity and acyclicity. I use them to try to resolve some key issues in population ethics, concerning the value of creating new people and the procreative asymmetry. In Chapter 6 I aim to support these transfinite principles by analysing their role in the theory of rational choice.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract12' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'>Abstract: This paper develops transfinite extensions of transitivity and acyclicity in the context of population ethics. They are used to argue that it is better to add good lives, worse to add bad lives, and equally good to add neutral lives, where a life’s value is understood as personal value. These conclusions rule out a number of theories of population ethics, feed into an argument for the repugnant conclusion, and allow us to reduce different number comparisons to same number ones. Challenges to these arguments are addressed, including the issue of comparing existence and nonexistence in terms of personal value, the possibility of minimal quanta of time and life, and the meaningfulness of measuring closeness between outcomes with different population sizes. An asymmetry is uncovered between transfinite cycles of worseness and betterness, supporting a version of the weak procreative asymmetry. Transfinite transitivity principles are also favourably compared to the better known principles of continuity.</blockquote>

Johnston argues that personites do not exist since otherwise personites would have the same moral status as persons, which is untenable. I argue that Johnston’s arguments fail. To do that I propose an alternative way to understand intrinsicness and I clarify the meaning of reductionism about persons. I also argue that a plausible ethical theory is possible even if personites have the same moral status as persons. My arguments draw on Johnston’s earlier debate with Parfit about personal identity and the place of ordinary concerns in a naturalistic world. I also describe an important but metaphysics free problem that arises from Johnston’s discussion.</blockquote>

The puzzle implicates three intuitively appealing and theoretically foundational principles of ethics and decision theory, roughly that (i) other things being equal it is better to benefit more individuals rather than fewer, (ii) a prospect is better if its outcome is certain to be better no matter what, and (iii) two prospects are equally good if one gives every possible individual the same probabilities of the same outcomes as the other. I explain why the puzzle matters, especially for utilitarians in the tradition of Harsanyi. I compare my puzzle to other similar puzzles. I sketch some possible solutions, including the proposal that in infinite ethics there is indeterminacy between multiple concepts of betterness.</blockquote>

I will then argue that the most worrisome such cycles mean that commonsense deontology can sometimes tell us to do what is worse for individual people.

It can be characterized by three axioms: ordering, independence, and continuity. There are multiple money pump arguments designed to support ordering and independence. But so far no such arguments seem to have been offered to support continuity. This article shows that no such argument is possible. It explains what money pumps are, what decision problems could be money pumps against discontinuous preferers, and why no such money pump can actually be constructed. The paper also thereby demonstrates the limits of what can be achieved by pragmatic arguments in decision theory.</blockquote>

It shows that if Allais preferences track individual betterness, then we cannot hold on to independently plausible ethical principles: ex ante Pareto, statewise dominance, and anonymity. The paper shows that proponents of Allais preferences will find it difficult to reject these three principles. This suggests that Allais preferences cannot track individual betterness after all. In short, Allais preferences are bad for you.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract12' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'>Abstract: This paper argues that the project of comparing infinite worlds in terms of betterness is even harder than philosophers have thought. In particular, it shows that controversial principles of continuity in some well-known impossibility theorems can be replaced by related but significantly more compelling principles of transfinite transitivity and transfinite acyclicity. These are natural infinite generalizations of transitivity and acyclicity, which are two well-established principles of value theory. Like continuity, transfinite transitivity and acyclicity are sensitive to the choice of a topology, here understood in terms of convergence and closeness. Two notions of convergence are discussed. The first main result is that, given transfinite transitivity and the first notion of convergence, it is impossible to combine a weak Pareto principle and finite anonymity. The second main result is that, given transfinite acyclicity and the second notion of convergence, it is impossible to combine strong Pareto and finite anonymity, impossible to combine transitivity and the Pigou Dalton principle, and impossible to accept an uncontroversial extension of utilitarianism to infinite worlds.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract13' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'>Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between rational choice theory and the principle of transfinite transitivity, a generalization of transitivity in contexts where our domain of evaluation is equipped with a notion of convergence. The interest of transfinite transitivity comes from its applications: in variable population ethics it can be used to argue that it is always worse to create a miserable life and that it is always better to create a happy life, and in infinite population ethics it can be used to establish the impossibility of combining a Pareto principle and a weak anonymity principle. This paper will argue that if transitivity can be supported by the role it plays in the theory of rational choice, then so can transfinite transitivity. In finite option sets, transitivity helps secure the existence of choiceworthy options, is implied by consistency conditions on permissible choice, and can be supported by money pump arguments. This paper shows that transfinite transitivity plays the same role in infinite compact sets, and that nothing else can plausibly play the same role in infinite noncompact sets. The role of compactness is clarified and defended. The distinctions developed in the paper are then applied to a classic infinite-decision puzzle, Satan’s Apple.</blockquote>

            <blockquote id='abstract15' class="paragraph_style_5" style='display:none'>Abstract: I defend two Parfitian arguments for the unimportance of personal identity in morality: the argument from extrinsicness and the argument from nonsubstantiveness. The first starts by showing that personal identity is wildly extrinsic in cases where people divide and merge like amoebas, given any view of what happens in these cases. Given a plausible assumption about change over time, personal identity is wildly extrinsic in cases of extremely long lived people whose bodies and minds gradually change like ours do. I conclude that nothing of moral importance can depend on personal identity, since morally important factors cannot be wildly extrinsic like that. Unlike Parfit’s own arguments, mine assume very little by way of metaphysics of personal identity. My second argument identifies a coherent and plausible sense in which personal identity is not substantive, drawing on Field’s and Lewis’s discussion of indeterminacy in theoretical identifications. My two arguments are meant to avoid multiple objections to Parfit, due to Ernest Sosa, Mark Johnston, David Lewis, Barry Dainton, and Anthony Brueckner, among others. I end by suggesting what my arguments mean for value theory.</blockquote>
