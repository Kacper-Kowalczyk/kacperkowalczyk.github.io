                         <p class="paragraph_style_4"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper develops transfinite extensions of transitivity and acyclicity principles in axiology, and applies them to the problem of evaluating outcomes where different numbers of people exist. In that context transfinite transitivity can be used to argue that it is always good to add good lives, bad to add bad lives, and neutral to add neutral lives, where the value of a life is understood as the value for its subject. This conclusion rules out many prominent theories of how to compare outcomes where different numbers of people exist, such as average and critical level utilitarianism and it allows us to reduce variable population axiology to fixed population axiology. As a generalization of the controversial but popular principle of transitivity, transfinite transitivity is intuitively appealing and can be seen as similarly fundamental in axiology. The results of this paper therefore promise to break new ground in the field of population axiology. Transfinite transitivity and related principles are also compared to the better known principles of continuity and hypersensitivity avoidance.<br></p>
                     <p class="paragraph_style_4"> The risky existential question and the repugnant conclusion (joint work with Michal Masny) <br></p>        
                         <p class="paragraph_style_4"> <i>Abstract</i>: In "An Intrapersonal Addition Paradox" (2019), Jake Nebel presents a novel argument for the Repugnant Conclusion which is meant to be more compelling than the existing ones. This paper develops a range of responses to this argument. Along the way, it addresses a number of issues whose importance extends to the whole field of population ethics: the individual value of prospects involving a chance of nonexistence, the adequacy of perfectionism, the "containers of value" objection, and the relevance of the ex ante/ex post distinction in variable-population contexts.<br></p>  
                     <p class="paragraph_style_4"> Yet another argument against anti-aggregation <br></p>
                         <p class="paragraph_style_4"> <i>Abstract</i>: Anti aggregationists cannot accept all of the following principles (construed in terms of permissible choice): Weak Ex Ante Pareto, Weak Statewise Dominance, Risk Tolerance, and No Moral Dilemmas. This forces them to choose between ex ante and ex post approaches to anti aggregation. The trouble is that they should accept restricted versions of Weak Ex Ante Pareto and Weak Statewise Dominance, and it is hard to accept their restricted but not full versions. While this last argument relies on ruling out cyclical choice patterns, standard anti aggregationist treatment of such cycles doesn’t work in this case. Anti aggregationists also cannot appeal to resources that egalitarians have used in response to similar problems regarding ex post/ex ante inequality. In the case of anti aggregationism, the ex post/ex ante inconsistency can lead to the so called “problem of ex ante rules” which turns out to be less tractable than has been thought. While no decisive disproof of anti aggregationism is offered, its defence is made substantially more difficult.<br></p>
                     <p class="paragraph_style_4"> Allais preferences are bad for you <br></p>
                         <p class="paragraph_style_4"> <i>Abstract</i>: There has been a long debate about the rationality of Allais preferences. This paper is about the ethics of Allais preferences. It shows that if Allais preferences track individual betterness, then we cannot hold on to independently plausible ethical principles: ex ante Pareto, statewise dominance and anonymity. The paper considers the egalitarian challenge to this combination of principles and shows that it does not apply here. There is little other reason to doubt their current application. The suggested conclusion is that Allais preferences cannot track individual betterness after all. In short, Allais preferences are bad for you.<br></p> 
                     <p class="paragraph_style_4"> Equality and population size <br></p>
                         <p class="paragraph_style_4"> <i>Abstract</i>: There are two kinds of egalitarianism: communal and weighted. According to the former, the value of an outcome is the result of balancing total wellbeing and the badness of inequality. According to the latter, it is the result of aggregating people’s wellbeing while giving priority to the relatively worse off. Unlike communal egalitarianism, weighted egalitarianism escapes the levelling down objection and can be supported by a veil of ignorance argument. While the two kinds of egalitarianism can generate the same verdicts in same number cases, they diverge in different number cases in a way which poses a significant dilemma for weighted egalitarians. On the one hand, they have good reasons to accept limited principles of existence independence which leads to a specific formula for calculating the value of an outcome. On the other hand, the most straightforward application of this formula in different number cases yields counterintuitive verdicts which are at odds with egalitarian thinking. The dilemma suggests that weighted egalitarianism is not egalitarian, after all, so egalitarians should accept communal egalitarianism instead.<br></p> 
                     <p class="paragraph_style_4"> Risk times infinity <br></p>
                         <p class="paragraph_style_4"> <i>Abstract</i>: This paper introduces a new puzzle for utilitarianism in infinite worlds. It shows that ex ante Pareto and statewise dominance are incompatible with a nearly uncontroversial utilitarian claim about outcomes where infinitely many people exist. The three principles at issue are then clarified and defended. The incompatibility means that utilitarianism is ex ante/ex post inconsistent in infinite worlds. It is well known that ex ante/ex post inconsistency is a source of problems for egalitarians and prioritarians in finite worlds.  It turns out that utilitarians share these problems. The paper then explains how the problem is an example of an “infinite free lunch” and how it is related to other problem cases for utilitarianism in infinite worlds. <br></p>
